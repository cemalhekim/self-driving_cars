# self-driving_cars
This repository documents my journey to mastering autonomous vehicles, starting with Udacity's Intro to Self-Driving Cars course. It includes projects, exercises, and implementations of key concepts like computer vision, sensor fusion, and path planning. Future coursework and experiments will also be added.
